Ember Addon for Zurb Foundation 5 library and Ember components

***Warning*: This is an ember-addon library that is in heavy development! Use at your own risk.**

## Install & Setup

Within an ember-cli app, run:

```sh
npm install --save-dev ember-foundation
```

Next, run the blueprint for ember-foundation:

```sh
ember generate ember-foundation
```

## Stylesheets

### Using SASS

In your app.scss, simply import "ember-foundation":

```scss
// app/styles/app.scss

@import "ember-foundation";
```

This will include normalize.css and all Foundation styles.

### Using CSS

To use plain CSS, you'll need to import the CSS files within your Brocfile.js:

```js
// Brocfile.js

app.import('bower_components/foundation/css/normalize.css');
app.import('bower_components/foundation/css/foundation.css');
```

## Component Documentation Pages

The tests/dummy app included in this repository includes demos and examples for all of the Ember-based components. You can view this app at its public location, [http://joshforisha.github.io/ember-foundation](Ember-Foundation). To build the app yourself, simply run `ember serve` or `ember build` from the root folder of this addon.

Note that you will need to have the development dependencies installed for the addon, so an `npm install` and `bower install` might be necessary as well.
